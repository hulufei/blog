Just wrote a simple diary plugin for Neovim. I was happy to develop it with [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/),
a language compile to Lua with the flexibility of Lisp syntax.

Reflection is an important part of diary writing.

The plugin's features are straightforward:

- A command to start a new diary entry at any time.
- A command to review a randomly picked diary entry.
- A command to revisit "yesterday once more".
- A command to generate a Table of Contents (TOC) for all diary entries in an index file.
