It's not convenient to "hard" press the trackpad to select text. Fortunately, there are trackpad
options for dragging style. But it's kind of deeply hiding.

It's located at: System Preferences > Accessibility > Pointer Control > Trackpad Options.

The [official documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-kw/guide/mac-help/unac899/mac) explain these options pretty well:

_Dragging style_: Choose an option to control dragging.

- _Without Drag Lock_: Double-tap an item, then drag it without lifting your finger after the second tap; when you lift your finger, the item stops moving. The item can still be dragged for a fraction of a second (so you can reposition your finger if itâ€™s at the edge of the trackpad). To immediately prevent further dragging, tap the trackpad once.
- _With Drag Lock_: Double-tap an item, then drag it without lifting your finger after the second tap; dragging continues when you lift your finger, and stops when you tap the trackpad once.
- _Three Finger Drag_: Drag an item with three fingers; dragging stops when you lift your fingers.

I prefer _With Drag Lock_, no tricks:)
