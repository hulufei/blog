It's not always convenient to "hard press" the trackpad to select text. Fortunately, macOS
provides trackpad options for easier dragging, though they are somewhat hidden.

To access these options:
**System Preferences > Accessibility > Pointer Control > Trackpad Options > Enable dragging.**

The [official documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-kw/guide/mac-help/unac899/mac) explain these options well:

- **Without Drag Lock**: Double-tap an item, then drag it without lifting your finger after the second tap; when you lift your finger, the item stops moving. The item can still be dragged for a fraction of a second (so you can reposition your finger if it’s at the edge of the trackpad). To immediately prevent further dragging, tap the trackpad once.
- **With Drag Lock**: Double-tap an item, then drag it without lifting your finger after the second tap; dragging continues when you lift your finger, and stops when you tap the trackpad once.
- **Three Finger Drag**: Drag an item with three fingers; dragging stops when you lift your fingers.

Personally, I prefer **With Drag Lock**—simple and effective!
